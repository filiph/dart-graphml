# dart-graphml

A miminal Dart library that reads and writes .graphml files.  [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) is a format used by [yEd](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html), the free and cross-platform graph editor. (Among others.)

See `example/example.dart` for .. eh .. an example. Of use, I mean.

This library uses the [dart-xml](https://github.com/prujohn/dart-xml) library (and hacks on it).
